🚜 FuelTrack 

A precision fuel-tracking system for farms and machinery fleets.

FuelTrack  is an invite-only iOS app designed to accurately log fuel usage across multiple tanks and machines. It uses metering data from real-world fuel pumps to ensure every recorded fill matches what was actually dispensed.

⭐ Features
🔹 Multi-Tank Support

Add and manage multiple fuel tanks, each with its own metering unit.

🔹 Accurate Fill Logging

Each tank has two counters:

Partial Counter – Reset before each fill; shows litres dispensed for that single event.

Total Counter – Lifetime tank total; never resets.

Users record both values for every fill.

🔹 Automatic Reconciliation

FuelTrack  compares:

Volume from partial counter

Volume calculated from total-counter change

The system highlights differences greater than 5 litres (configurable tolerance).

🔹 Machine Fuel Histories

Track how much each machine receives over time and from which tank.

🔹 Tank Usage Auditing

Each tank shows:

Total litres dispensed

Meter-based total

Difference between recorded usage and meter readings
This helps identify misreads, leaks, or unaccounted fuel.


🔐 Access Requirements

FuelTrack  is invite-only.
Users must be apved and authenticated by the system administrator.
